# Java Multi-Threading Experiments
## Description:
This repository contains hands-on experiments and implementations related to Java multi-threading and concurrency. The goal is to explore different threading concepts, improve performance optimization skills, and understand real-world use cases of multi-threading in backend development.

### Topics Covered  
✔️ Creating and Managing Threads (`Thread` & `Runnable`)  
✔️ Synchronization & Thread Safety (`synchronized`, `lock`, `volatile`)  
✔️ Executor Framework & Thread Pools  
✔️ Fork/Join Framework for Parallel Processing  
✔️ Deadlocks & How to Avoid Them  
✔️ Atomic Variables & Concurrent Data Structures  
✔️ Asynchronous Programming with `CompletableFuture`  

### Why This Project?  
As a **backend developer** working on scalable and high-performance applications, mastering multi-threading is essential. This repository serves as a **learning playground** to implement, test, and document multi-threading concepts while building efficient and thread-safe applications.  

### How to Use?  
✔️ Clone the repository  
✔️ Explore different Java classes covering various threading concepts  
✔️ Run the test cases to understand behavior  
✔️ Modify and experiment with different scenarios  

### Future Enhancements  
🔹 Implement real-world multi-threading use cases (e.g., Rate Limiting, Background Jobs)   
🔹 Optimize performance with profiling tools   
🔹 Explore Reactive Programming with Project Reactor
